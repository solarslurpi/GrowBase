# üëã About the GrowBase Project

GrowBase is a Raspberry Pi-based system connected to a local wi-fi that serves as the base station for the MistBuddy, CO2Buddy, and SnifferBuddy projects. It provides a centralized platform for monitoring and controlling environmental conditions in grow environments. _All data remains local. Nothing is sent to a cloud service._

# üôè Thanks to Those That Went Before
- **THANK YOU Adafruit**: [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/) is an incredible company that consistently inspires and empowers the maker community with innovative products and resources. Their commitment to education and open-source hardware is unmatched, thanks to the vision and leadership of their founders. Thank you for making such a positive impact on so many lives.
- **THANK YOU Raspberry Pi Foundation**: For creating an affordable, versatile computing platform that serves as the heart of this project.

# üî© Build the GrowBase
>**CAVEAT**: I have been using a build using these parts. As in "it works for me." I am not a professional. I am sharing with in hopes it can benefit others. I am not responsible for any damages to your home or property.

## üí∞ BoM

The supplies needed to build GrowBase include:

| Component | Cost | Reason |
|-----------|------|--------|
| [Rasp 4 w 4GB](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4296) | $55.00 | This is what I use.  It is working well.
| [USB-C Power Supply for Rasp Pi](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4298) | $7.95 | Official Raspberry Pi Power Supply 5.1V 3A with USB C one with data wires. __Note: the Raspberry Pi 4 (5V via USB type-C up to 3A) uses a different power supply than the Raspberry Pi 3 (5V via micro USB up to 2.5A)__
| [micro SD card](https://amzn.to/3W3yvHa) | $16 | Two amazon basics 64 GB.
| enclosure | pennies | The model I chose is [Malolo's](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3723561) [screw-less](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3723561) snap-fit[ Raspberry Pi](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3723561) 3 and 4 cases. <br>Specifically the one-color slot base and the two-color hex top.

## üõ†Ô∏è Build the Enclosure

| Component | File
|-----------|------|
| top | The top can be multicolored yet does not require a 3D printer that can print multiple filaments at once.<br>The two files include [Pi4 Top Hex color 1](../enclosures/GrowBuddy/Pi4_Top_Hex_MM2_Color1.stl) and [Pi4 Top Hex color 2](../enclosures/GrowBuddy/Pi4_Top_Hex_MM2_Color2.stl).  If you are unsure how to print for <br>multi-color, Malalo has provide [multi-color printing directions](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3719217)
| bottom | [Pi4 Bottom with slots](../enclosures/GrowBuddy/Pi4_Bottom_Slots_SM.stl)
#### Raspberry Pi 3 Case
Raspberry Pi 3 (I've tried it.  But better just to start with the Raspberry Pi 4):
| Component | File |
|-----------|------|
| top | Similar to the top for the Raspberry Pi 4, two files are used.  The first is [Pi3 Top Hex color 1](../enclosures/GrowBuddy/Pi3_Top_Hex_MM2_Color1.stl).<br>The second is [Pi3 Top Hex color 2](../enclosures/GrowBuddy/Pi3_Top_Hex_MM2_Color2.stl)
| bottom | [Pi3 Bottom with slots](../enclosures/GrowBuddy/PI3_Bottom_Slots_SM.stl)

Fit the Raspberry Pi into the enclosure after it has been printed.


## üñ•Ô∏è Install the Software

### 1. Install Raspberry Pi OS

   The easiest way is to use the [Raspberry Pi imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) on the micro SD card.
      - Install the latest Raspberry Pi Lite 64 bit OS.
      - Adafruit has [a nice walk through](https://learn.adafruit.com/raspberry-pi-zero-creation/using-rpi-imager).
      - Make sure to set your wifi, host, and other info.

### Verify the Install

Put the micro SD card into the Raspberry Pi and power up the Raspberry Pi. Open up a terminal window and try to `ssh` in:
```
ssh pi@<ip address on the Raspberry Pi>
```
After entering your password, you should be in the command prompt:
```
pi@<ip address>:~ $
```
If you cannot reach your GrowBase from your Mac/PC, first check to see if the raspberry pi is on your home wifi by using a utility like [Angry IP](https://angryip.org/).  If it is not, perhaps [this troubleshooting guide](raspi-nowifi) can help.


### 2. Install and Configure the MQTT Broker

[This source](http://www.steves-internet-guide.com/mosquitto-broker/) provides more information on the mosquitto broker.

   - Connect to your Raspberry Pi via SSH.
   - Update the system: `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y`
   - Install Mosquitto: `sudo apt install mosquitto mosquitto-clients -y`
   - Check Mosquitto status: `sudo systemctl status mosquitto`
   - If not running, start Mosquitto: `sudo systemctl start mosquitto`
   - Enable Mosquitto: `sudo systemctl enable mosquitto`
   - Create a custom configuration file:
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/mosquitto/conf.d/connect.conf
     ```
   - Copy and paste the following into the new connect.conf file:
     ```bash
     listener 1883
     protocol mqtt

     listener 9000
     protocol websockets

     allow_anonymous true
     ```
   - Save the file (Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter)
   - Restart Mosquitto to apply the changes:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl restart mosquitto
     ```
> Note: If you are only building MistBuddy-Lite, this is all you need.  Happy Misting!

(The rest of the documentation will be completed as the other Buddies come on line).
